# concatenation is a fancy way of saying connecting
# we want to concatenate "Python is" and " fun"
# (the space before "fun" will soon become obvious)

# this print statement will not have the correct spacing
print("Python is" + "fun")

# you need to add a space. It can be before or after the 
# first concatenating word.
print("Python is " + "fun")
print("Python is" + " fun")
